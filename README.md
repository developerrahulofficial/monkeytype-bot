The Monkeytype bot assists fellow typists who may not have fast typing skills in improving their speed. Remember, 'MONKEY SEE, MONKEY HELP IN MONKEY TYPE.' The bot allows customization of the interval periods between words, with added noise to simulate human-like typing. It can also introduce errors, and the error rate is customizable as well.
